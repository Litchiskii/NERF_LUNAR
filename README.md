# NERF_LUNAR
This project aims to apply Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Narrow Angle Camera (LRO-NAC) dataset to generate high-quality 3D reconstructions of the lunar surface. The LRO-NAC dataset provides high-resolution images of the Moon, which are used in conjunction with NeRF to create detailed and realistic 3D models.
